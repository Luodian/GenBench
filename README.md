# GenBench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Generative Data for Visual Recognition

The machine learning (ML) community has a history of successfully constructing and utilizing datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. 

However, this process is frequently time-consuming and costly, requiring considerable effort. The community faces a shortage of efficient, high-productivity open data engineering tools to facilitate the creation, upkeep, and assessment of datasets, resulting in reduced efficiency and increased costs. 

Consequently, the primary challenge is to expedite dataset creation and modification while improving the efficacy of usage and reuse through the democratization of data engineering and evaluation.
